async function setup() {
  try {
    const account = await createNGOAccount();
    console.log('NGO account created:', account);
    // Store these keys securely!
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating account:', error);
  }
}

setup();
```

### Distributing Funds to Beneficiaries

```javascript
const { distributeFunds } = require('./src/aidDistribution');

async function sendAid() {
  try {
    const ngoSecretKey = 'S...'; // Your NGO account secret key
    const beneficiaries = [
      { publicKey: 'G...', amount: '10.5' },
      { publicKey: 'G...', amount: '15.75' }
    ];
    
    const result = await distributeFunds(ngoSecretKey, beneficiaries);
    console.log('Funds distributed successfully:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error distributing funds:', error);
  }
}

sendAid();
```

### Creating Time-Locked Transfers

```javascript
const { createTimeLockedTransfer } = require('./src/conditionalTransfers');

async function schedulePayment() {
  try {
    const ngoSecretKey = 'S...'; // Your NGO account secret key
    const beneficiaryPublicKey = 'G...'; // Beneficiary public key
    const amount = '50'; // Amount in XLM
    const unlockDate = new Date('2023-12-31'); // Date when funds become available
    
    const result = await createTimeLockedTransfer(
      ngoSecretKey, 
      beneficiaryPublicKey,
      amount,
      unlockDate
    );
    
    console.log('Time-locked transfer created:', result);
  } catch (error) {

## üß™ Testing on Stellar Testnet

This toolkit is configured to work with the Stellar testnet by default. To get testnet XLM for testing:

1. Generate a new Stellar keypair
2. Visit the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)
3. Enter your public key and click "Create Account"

Alternatively, you can use the Friendbot directly:
```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
```
